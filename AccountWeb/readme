this is the second app but with using of Migrations concept wih EF.

same gose to the first one, I have creat the model class which has the datasbe model properties.
then with the useing of Nug packets console, I have enablle the Migrations and then I added it to the server. 
then with the use of addview, it helps to add the four concepts (CRUD) automatically witht the controllers as well.
